The Music Streaming App is a C++ console-based application designed to simulate a simple music library and playlist management system.
It allows users to manage a digital collection of songs, albums, and artists, and offers features like creating personalized playlists,
browsing music by artist or album, and storing music data persistently using text files.
The project demonstrates core object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, file handling, and modular design.
